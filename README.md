# Tutorial: Continuous Integration for Serverless Applications

Continuous Integration is the practice of merging all working copies of
developer code into one shared mainline several times a day. Best practices
include automation of builds and deployments, with fast and self-testing
builds, as well as production-like testing environments. With serverless, the
continuous integration pipeline evolves from a one-lane, one-way street into a
multiple-lane, two-way highway.

In this tutorial, we take a simple serverless application and walk you through
the steps to set up unit testing, end-to-end testing, code coverage, code
analysis, code security, code performance, and peer code review. You can learn
how to use AWS serverless components in combination with GitHub, Travis-CI,
CodeClimate, Snyk and other serverless-friendly services.
